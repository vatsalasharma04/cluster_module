explaination of the code line by line:

const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;


1. `const cluster = require('cluster');`: This line imports the `cluster` module, which is a part of Node.js's standard library. It provides the ability to create child processes (workers) that can share server ports.

2. `const http = require('http');`: Here, we import the built-in `http` module. This module allows us to create an HTTP server.

3. `const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;`: This line uses the `os` module (also built-in) to get the number of CPU cores available on the system. This value is stored in `numCPUs`.


if (cluster.isMaster) {
  // Fork workers for each core
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  // Listen for worker online event
  cluster.on('online', (worker) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} is online`);
  });

  // Listen for exit event
  cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`);
  });
} else {
  // Create a simple HTTP server
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('Hello, I am a worker!');
  }).listen(8000);
}


4. `if (cluster.isMaster) {`: This checks if the current process is the master process. The master process is responsible for creating and managing child processes.

5. `for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) { cluster.fork(); }`: This loop creates child processes (workers). The number of workers created is equal to the number of CPU cores (`numCPUs`). Each worker runs the same code.

6. `cluster.on('online', (worker) => { console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} is online`); });`: This listens for the 'online' event, which is emitted when a worker becomes online. It logs a message indicating the worker's process ID (PID).

7. `cluster.on('exit', (worker, code, signal) => { console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died`); });`: This listens for the 'exit' event, which is emitted when a worker process exits (dies). It logs a message indicating the worker's PID.

8. `} else {`: If the current process is not the master process, it means it's a worker process.

9. `http.createServer((req, res) => { res.writeHead(200); res.end('Hello, I am a worker!'); }).listen(8000);`: In the worker process, we create a simple HTTP server. It responds with a status code of 200 (which means "OK") and the message "Hello, I am a worker!" when a request is made.

This code effectively uses the Cluster module to create multiple worker processes that share the load of handling incoming requests, making use of multiple CPU cores.
